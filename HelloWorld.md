# Hello, World!

Welcome to my Data Science Coursera repository.

This is a sample markdown file that I'm adding to my repository. It's the traditional "Hello, World!" message in the world of programming. I'm excited to learn and share data science projects and resources here.

Feel free to explore my repository, and let's embark on this data science journey together!

Happy coding!
